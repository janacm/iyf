  # macOS only: the alert is an AppKit/WebKit window, wired through launchd and
  # the macOS frontmost-app APIs. The Command Line Tools provide the Swift
  # toolchain and macOS SDK needed to build ada-alert; full Xcode is not required.

    # Install the repo tree intact into libexec. Every script resolves its
    # siblings relative to its own location (ada.sh -> lib/ada-show-alert.sh ->
    # ../ada-alert), so preserving the layout means the path resolution keeps
    # working with no code changes. Dir["*"] skips dotfiles, so .build is left out.
    libexec.install Dir["*"]

    # Drop the built helpers where __ada_find_native_alert looks first
    # ($repo/ada-alert), so the installer never tries to rebuild into the
    # read-only Cellar.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      ada is installed but not yet wired up. Run:

        ada-setup

      That presents an interactive selector and edits ~/.zshrc and (if present)
      ~/.claude / ~/.codex hook configs, and can install the Paseo LaunchAgent
      watcher. It writes timestamped backups before any JSON edit and is
      idempotent, so re-run it any time to change which integrations are active.

      Scriptable form:

        ada-setup --agents terminal,claude,codex
        ada-setup --list
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # --list short-circuits before any system mutation, so it is safe to run in
    # the sandbox and proves the script + its bundled deps are wired correctly.
    assert_match "terminal", shell_output("#{bin}/ada-setup --list")
    assert_path_exists bin/"ada-alert"
