# Requirements

This is the living requirements record for `iyf`. Update it whenever a product,
integration, configuration, or operational requirement is added, changed, or
removed.

## Baseline

- `iyf` must run on macOS from a zsh shell hook for terminal command alerts.
- `iyf` must be distributed as open source under the MIT License.
- The user-facing documentation of record is `README.md`.
- Maintainer/debugging documentation is duplicated in `CLAUDE.md` and
  `AGENTS.md`; keep those files aligned when changing maintainer guidance.
- This file tracks durable behavior requirements. It should not duplicate every
  implementation detail, but it must capture externally visible behavior and
  cross-system contracts.

## Open Source Distribution

- The repository must include `LICENSE` with the MIT License text.
- `README.md` must link to the license, contribution guide, and security policy.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` must document the basic development setup, validation
  commands, docs requirements, and security-sensitive contribution boundaries.
- `SECURITY.md` must explain how to report vulnerabilities privately and call
  out the security-sensitive local surfaces: shell startup, agent hooks,
  LaunchAgents, prompt or command capture, loopback control, and file staging.
- The public documentation must state that the core utility is local-first and
  does not send telemetry, prompts, command labels, repository names, or local
  paths to a remote service.
- Open-source distribution must not require publishing generated SwiftPM build
  output or local machine configuration.

## Onboarding Installer

- `iyf-install.sh` must provide the coworker-ready onboarding entry point for
  choosing which integrations trigger IYF.
- The installer must offer an interactive terminal selector when run from a TTY
  and a scriptable `--agents` path for non-interactive install flows.
- The selector must include Terminal commands, Claude Code, Codex, and Paseo as
  independently selectable integrations.
- The shared alert runtime files, including the native `iyf-alert` helper, must
  be treated as always included; the selector controls integration wiring, not
  whether the launcher exists.
- The installer must build or validate the native `iyf-alert` helper before it
  installs integrations or fires a sample alert.
- The installer must detect whether each integration target is available before
  selecting or installing it.
- The installer must be idempotent: re-running it must update existing managed
  IYF wiring without duplicating shell source blocks or hook entries.
- Shell setup must use a clearly marked managed block in `~/.zshrc`.
- Claude Code setup must merge `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` hooks into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` without removing unrelated hooks.
- Codex setup must merge `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` hooks into
  `~/.codex/hooks.json` without removing unrelated hooks.
- JSON hook setup must write a timestamped backup before changing an existing
  settings file.
- Paseo setup through the installer must delegate to `iyf-paseo-watch.sh install`
  so the LaunchAgent staging behavior stays centralized.
- The installer must support `--list`, `--dry-run`, and `--no-test` for
  validation, documentation, and automation.

## Terminal Command Alerts

- `iyf.sh` must register zsh `preexec` and `precmd` hooks.
- `preexec` must record the command label and start time before execution.
- `precmd` must measure elapsed time, capture the exit code, and trigger an
  alert only when the elapsed time exceeds `IYF_THRESHOLD`.
- Commands whose basename appears in `IYF_IGNORE_CMDS` must not trigger alerts.
- When `IYF_SKIP_OWN_TERMINAL=1`, an alert must be suppressed if the terminal
  that ran the command is the frontmost macOS app at completion.
- Entries in `IYF_SKIP_WHEN_ACTIVE` must suppress alerts when the frontmost app
  bundle id exactly matches an entry or the app name contains an entry.
- If the frontmost app cannot be determined, `iyf` must err toward showing the
  alert.
- The manual `iyf ...` helper must trigger the shared alert path for testing.

## Shared Alert Launcher

- `iyf-show-alert.sh` is the canonical launcher used by terminal, Claude/Codex,
  and Paseo entry points.
- The alert must show the command or prompt label, formatted duration, exit
  status, auto-close countdown, and git repository badge when a repository can
  be resolved.
- Labels and badge text containing URL-reserved characters must display as
  human-readable text, not transport encoding artifacts.
- Repository display must be resolved once by the launcher and preserved across
  snoozed relaunches.
- `IYF_REPO` must override repository display, including an explicit empty
  value to hide the badge.
- `IYF_REPO_DIR` must allow callers whose current directory is not the project
  directory to tell the launcher where to resolve the repository name.
- `IYF_ALERT_FILE` must allow callers to replace `alert.html` with another HTML
  file, including diagnostic pages.
- `IYF_AUTO_CLOSE` must control the alert auto-dismiss timeout, defaulting to a
  positive value when unset or invalid.
- `IYF_FOCUS_APP` and `IYF_FOCUS_APP_NAME` must allow click-anywhere dismissal
  to bring a source app forward and show a human-readable hint.
- Pressing `Esc`, clicking for a plain dismiss, or auto-close must dismiss the
  alert without requiring a snooze.
- Opening a new alert in native mode must close any previous native alert helper
  process so alert windows do not stack.

## Native Window Behavior

- The SwiftPM package must expose an `iyf-alert` executable product.
- The SwiftPM package must expose an optional `iyf-menubar` executable product
  that runs as a native macOS menu bar status item.
- The menu bar helper must not be an alert renderer or a replacement for the
  terminal, Claude/Codex, or Paseo integrations; it may provide convenience
  actions such as firing a sample alert and opening the IYF folder.
- The menu bar helper must trigger alerts through `iyf-show-alert.sh` so it
  shares the same native-only rendering path and configuration as every other
  entry point.
- The launcher must use the native `iyf-alert` helper when it is executable at
  `IYF_NATIVE_ALERT`, beside `iyf-show-alert.sh`, or in the SwiftPM
  `.build/release` or `.build/debug` output beside the launcher.
- The launcher must fail closed when `iyf-alert` is missing or not executable;
  it must not open Chrome, Brave, Edge, Safari, or any other browser as a
  fallback.
- The native helper must render the configured `IYF_ALERT_FILE` URL in a WebKit
  view without opening Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Safari.
- The alert must be an ordinary maximized window in the current Space, not a
  macOS native full-screen window in a new Space.
- The native alert window geometry must be based on the primary display's visible
  frame, below the menu bar and above the Dock.
- Pressing `Esc`, clicking, auto-close, and snooze must close the native helper
  process instead of relying on browser `window.close()` behavior.
- The native WebKit renderer must bridge snooze/focus requests to the existing
  loopback daemon so snooze and click-to-focus behavior remains available.

## Snooze And Focus

- `IYF_SNOOZE_MINUTES` must define the snooze button options, preserving an
  explicit empty value as "hide snooze buttons".
- The snooze bar must offer a "Custom" option that reveals a minutes input only
  once clicked; submitting it must request a snooze for the entered duration,
  subject to the same positive/≤24h bound as the preset buttons.
- Snooze and click-to-focus must use a detached `python3` loopback daemon because
  a sandboxed `file://` page cannot reliably outlive its window or activate
  another app later.
- The daemon must bind only to `127.0.0.1`, publish a random token to the alert
  URL, and ignore requests without that token.
- A snooze request must close the current alert and relaunch the same alert after
  the chosen delay.
- Snooze delays must be positive and no longer than 24 hours.
- A focus request must use the configured bundle id to bring the originating app
  forward, or, when `IYF_CLICK_URL` is set, `open` that URL instead (which both
  activates the target app and deep-links into it). The URL must take precedence
  over the bundle id, and a snooze relaunch must preserve it.
- The daemon must self-exit after the alert decision window if the user dismisses
  normally, the beacon is blocked, or the alert auto-closes.
- If `python3` or the daemon script is unavailable, snooze and focus must degrade
  cleanly without breaking the base alert.

## Claude Code And Codex Hooks

- `iyf-claude-hook.sh` must support the shared Claude Code and Codex hook payload
  shape from stdin.
- A `UserPromptSubmit` event must record the start timestamp and prompt text,
  keyed by `session_id`.
- A `Stop` event must compute elapsed turn time and trigger the shared launcher
  only when the elapsed time meets `IYF_CLAUDE_THRESHOLD`.
- The hook must honor the same active-app suppression rules as terminal command
  alerts.
- The hook must set `IYF_REPO_DIR` from the payload `cwd` so the launcher can
  display the project repository even when the hook's own current directory is
  different.
- On a `Stop` event, the hook must make the alert click open that turn's
  conversation in the Claude macOS app via the `claude://resume?session=<id>`
  deep link (passed through `IYF_CLICK_URL`). It must wire this only for genuine
  Claude Code sessions — the resolved session id must be a UUID and have a
  transcript at `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/projects/*/<id>.jsonl` — so
  Codex turns, which share the hook but cannot be imported into Claude.app, get
  no link rather than a "couldn't open session" error.
- If a Codex `Stop` payload has a different or missing `session_id`, the hook
  must fall back to the most recent start stamp only while it is younger than
  `IYF_CLAUDE_STALE_MAX`.
- The hook must remove consumed start and prompt state after handling a stop.
- Debug logging must remain opt-in through `IYF_DEBUG_LOG`, `IYF_DEBUG_LOG_FILE`,
  or the `${TMPDIR}/iyf-claude-debug.on` sentinel.
- Invalid, missing, or unparseable hook payloads must exit quietly without
  breaking the caller.

## Paseo Watcher

- The Paseo integration must be a poller, not a provider hook, because Paseo
  runs agents through its own daemon runtime.
- `iyf-paseo-watch.py` must poll the supported CLI JSON surfaces:
  `paseo ls --json` and `paseo permit ls --json`.
- The watcher must synthesize a finished-turn alert on `running -> idle` when
  elapsed time meets `IYF_PASEO_THRESHOLD`.
- The watcher must synthesize a failed-turn alert on `running -> error`.
- The watcher must synthesize a permission alert for newly observed pending
  permission requests.
- `IYF_PASEO_EVENTS` must allow any subset of `finish`, `error`, and
  `permission`.
- The watcher must default to suppressing alerts while the Paseo desktop app is
  frontmost, and `IYF_PASEO_SKIP_WHEN_ACTIVE` must allow that default to be
  changed or disabled.
- The watcher must tolerate transient CLI or JSON failures by treating them as
  empty snapshots rather than crashing.
- The watcher must seed initial state before alerting so agents already running
  at watcher startup do not produce bogus elapsed durations.
- Permission alerts must be deduplicated while the same permission request
  remains pending.

## Paseo LaunchAgent

- `iyf-paseo-watch.sh install` must stage its runtime into a non-TCC-protected
  directory (`IYF_PASEO_INSTALL_DIR`, default `~/.local/share/iyf`) before
  loading launchd.
- The staged runtime must include `iyf-paseo-watch.sh`,
  `iyf-paseo-watch.py`, `iyf-show-alert.sh`, `iyf-snooze-daemon.py`, and
  `alert.html`. Staging must mirror the dev-checkout layout — the front door
  (`iyf-paseo-watch.sh`) and `alert.html` at the top, the internal scripts under
  `lib/` — so every `lib/`-relative reference resolves identically whether run
  from a checkout or from the staged LaunchAgent.
- `iyf-paseo-watch.sh install` must stage a native helper executable. If
  `iyf-alert` is not already built, it may build it with SwiftPM when the source
  checkout contains `Package.swift`; if it cannot stage the helper, install must
  fail instead of relying on a browser fallback.
- The LaunchAgent must run from the staged path so it does not fail when the
  live checkout is under `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads`, or a symlink
  into those TCC-protected locations.
- The LaunchAgent must include a PATH that can find common `paseo`, `python3`,
  and system tool locations without relying on the user's interactive shell.
- `IYF_PASEO_ENV` must allow watcher configuration through an env file, defaulting
  to `paseo-watch.env` next to the running script.
- `iyf-paseo-watch.sh status` must report whether the job is loaded, whether a
  live poll loop is running, where the plist is, where the staged runtime is, and
  whether the watcher log is clean.
- `iyf-paseo-watch.sh uninstall` must unload the LaunchAgent and remove its
  plist.
- `iyf-paseo-watch.sh test` must fire one sample alert through the shared
  launcher.

## Dependencies And Degradation

- `zsh` is required for terminal command hook integration.
- `python3` is required for Claude/Codex hook JSON parsing, Paseo watcher polling,
  and snooze/focus support.
- The base terminal alert must still work without `python3`, but URL encoding,
  snooze, and click-to-focus may degrade.
- SwiftPM is required to build the native `iyf-alert` helper.
- A browser is not a runtime dependency. Missing Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Safari
  must not affect `iyf` when the native helper is built.
- `paseo` is required only for the Paseo watcher and may be found on `PATH`,
  under `~/.local/bin`, or in the Paseo application bundle.

## Documentation Requirements

- `README.md` must explain user-facing installation, configuration, integrations,
  and behavior.
- `README.md` must document the installer selector as the primary onboarding
  path and keep manual hook examples available for troubleshooting.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` must explain architectural gotchas, validation
  methods, and known dead ends for maintainer agents.
- This file must be updated when a durable requirement changes, even if the
  implementation and README changes are small.
- Docs-refresh automation should accept a no-op when the repo has no relevant
  changes and the docs still match implementation.

## Change Log

- 2026-06-19: Clicking a Claude Code alert now opens that turn's conversation in
  the Claude macOS app via the `claude://resume?session=<id>` deep link. Added a
  generic `IYF_CLICK_URL` click target (precedence over `IYF_FOCUS_APP`) wired
  through the launcher and snooze/focus daemon; the hook sets it only for real
  Claude Code sessions (UUID id with an on-disk transcript).
- 2026-06-17: Added open-source distribution requirements: MIT license,
  contribution guide, security policy, and local-first public documentation.
- 2026-06-17: Added an optional native SwiftPM `iyf-menubar` status item for
  convenience actions without changing the canonical alert launcher.
- 2026-06-15: Added the onboarding installer requirement: users can select
  Terminal, Claude Code, Codex, and Paseo integrations through
  `iyf-install.sh`, with scriptable and dry-run modes.
- 2026-06-15: Made native SwiftPM `iyf-alert` the only alert renderer; removed
  all browser fallback requirements.
- 2026-06-15: Added the initial requirements baseline. No implementation commits
  were present after the previous docs-automation boundary; this captures the
  current shipped behavior so future docs runs have a requirements record to
  maintain.
